- **Tableau**: Visualizations built to compare player stats and team performance
- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional)**: For additional visualization and narrative explanation


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice formulating SQL queries on sports analytics data
- Understand how to derive business insights from sports datasets
