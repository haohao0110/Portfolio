# Ark Case Studies

**Ark** was a reading and research group I founded in Fall 2021, following my summer internship at ORION Venture Partners. The group consisted of three members—myself (Howard), Tim, and Eva—and was created with the goal of developing foundational consulting skills in areas such as data interpretation, financial analysis, business modeling, and critical thinking.

Each case study was completed within one week, focusing on building our ability to:
- Rapidly analyze market trends
- Understand business history
- Construct independent, logical conclusions
- Update our internal knowledge base regularly

We met every Thursday to share our findings through presentations, cultivating the soft skill of **explaining complex ideas to an uninformed audience** in a clear and structured way.

Although this folder is not related to data analytics or machine learning, we were business students at the time, with only limited exposure to coding. Still, I believe **Ark gave us a powerful foundation in research discipline**, helping me later understand complex systems and market behavior more deeply as I entered data-driven roles.

The name **Ark** was inspired by the story of Noah's Ark in the Bible—carrying a small number of essential creatures through the flood. Likewise, this group emphasized **quality over quantity**: a compact team focused on sharpening essential thinking tools to weather future professional storms.

**Ark** 是我在 2021 年暑期結束 ORION Venture Partners 實習、開始大四學期時創立的讀書小組。組員包含我（Howard）、Tim 和 Eva，旨在培養基本的商業顧問素養，包含資料解讀、財務分析、商業模式理解，以及追根究柢的研究精神。

我們每週完成一份報告，訓練自己能夠：
- 快速掌握市場趨勢
- 深入了解商業歷史脈絡
- 形成屬於自己的邏輯與結論
- 定期更新自己的知識架構

小組固定每週四分享簡報，並訓練成員有能力將自己一週所學，**有效轉譯並傳達給毫無背景知識的他人**。

儘管這個資料夾與資料分析或機器學習無直接關聯，當時我們仍是主修企業管理與國際企業的學生，對程式設計的理解有限。但我相信 Ark 小組建立的研究訓練，讓我後來在分析市場資料時擁有比他人更深入與多元的理解力。

**Ark** 的命名靈感來自《聖經》中挪亞方舟的故事——在洪水中載著少量卻關鍵的生命體航行。這也象徵我們相信：「**團隊不必大，人要對，觀點要準**。」在這裡磨練的技能，將是未來在風暴中領航的能力。
